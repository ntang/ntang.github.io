<p><em>Asian pear &#8220;fries;&#8221; organic green and red seedless grape kebabs; mini whole wheat cheddar roll (fresh from a local bakery); half a clementine orange; organic nitrate/antibiotic-free turkey bacon</em></p>
<p>We are a family of bacon lovers.  Whether it&#8217;s &#8220;regular&#8221; pork bacon, <a href="http://www.applegatefarms.com/products/organic_turkey_bacon.aspx">turkey bacon</a>, or even <a href="http://www.dartagnan.com/51178/565588/Cured--Smoked-Meats/Uncured-Smoked-Duck-Bacon.html?CMCID=SEM_G_Duck_DuckBacon&amp;gclid=CNidp-PU2a0CFY-R7QodPSW02w">duck bacon</a> (wow, what a treat, especially when making gourmet BLT&#8217;s with tarragon and avocado!) &#8212; we don&#8217;t discriminate as long as it&#8217;s good quality meat free of nitrates, antibiotics and other junk.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s post features crispy bacon from humanely raised turkeys.  That&#8217;s right &#8212; turkey bacon can indeed by crispy and mouthwatering delicious when cooked correctly. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we do:</p>
<ul><li>preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
<li>line cookie sheet with tin foil</li>
<li>place bacon on sheet, being careful not to allow the slices to touch each other</li>
<li>bake for roughly 30 minutes, depending on the brand, thickness, etc.  I recommend setting the timer for 20 minutes and then keeping an eye on it until it reaches the desired crispiness.  </li>
</ul><p>If you want to work a little harder, a skillet works just as well, but you&#8217;ll have to keep a better eye on it and turn it at some point.  I think there is more room for error this way if you&#8217;re giving turkey bacon a go for the first time.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  Floppy turkey bacon be gone!  For the record, I like my bacon a bit crispier than what is photographed in the above bento, but I cooked it according to how the kids like it, so&#8230;  I left mine on the cookie sheet longer.  :0)</p>

					<div class="text_post">
					<p>In 2011, at thirty-seven years old, I made peace with my kitchen. Up until now it was a &#8212; what&#8217;s the word for something you only have because you have to have it? In my mind, a kitchen was like a junk drawer or a laundry hamper. You have one whether you like it or not. It&#8217;s not pretty, it&#8217;s there for a purpose, you toss things into it and run away as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Every meal. Every snack. Every drink. When you have young kids, it adds up to thousands of times every day that you are supposed to come up with something for everyone to eat. And for me, every one of those moments felt like a terrible chore.</p>
<p>And no wonder! Even when the kitchen was clean (hahaha) and all of the dishes were clean (???), absolute best case Tiffany&#8217;s kitchen was poorly thought out. The drawers and cabinets were overflowing with snarls of utensils, dull knives, annoying scattered measuring cup sets, hopelessly misshapen cookie cutters, mismatched silverware, spices that were way past their best-if-by dates. The world&#8217;s most talented chefs would have said forget it, let&#8217;s go out for pizza.</p>
<p>You would be horrified at how much we used to eat out. I do <em>like</em> eating out; it&#8217;s a social doing, it&#8217;s a nice outing, it&#8217;s fun to do. But! It should be a decision to go out because you want to go out&#8230; instead, our eating out was a matter of feeling overwhelmed at the thought of trying to cook anything.</p>
<p>But why was my kitchen so nonfunctional? It&#8217;s not like the government issues kitchen utensils and you are stuck with them for life. I was being crazy and childish, that&#8217;s why. Being a terrible cook was an unhealthy part of my identity somehow, and avoiding the kitchen was part of that. So! this year I challenged myself to make the kitchen an inviting place.</p>
<p>First I cleared out all the junk. Everything that was broken, redundant, hideous, or just plain ridiculous all went to goodwill. Then I researched what kinds of basic tools every kitchen needs. Then, even though I sort of hate shopping, I went shopping, combing Amazon for reviews, sneaking off to Target to peek at the cookware aisle. You don&#8217;t understand! This aisle is not for me! I don&#8217;t even know what a lot of this stuff is for!</p>
<p>The first thing I bought were some beautiful mixing bowls. I LOVE my bowls. They make me eager to mix things.</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="cookware" height="297" src="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/2/bowls.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Next was the fancy skillet. It&#8217;s ceramic and naturally non-stick and I love the fancy skillet. It makes me want to skillet things. I bought two knives, a pancake turner that doesn&#8217;t suck, and a few other very basic things that my goodness, why didn&#8217;t I have before? Things like a great measuring cup. And spoons! Measuring spoons!</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="spoons" height="422" src="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/2/spoons.jpg" width="350"/></p>
<p>And these things aren&#8217;t beautiful, but I love not having to dig for those tools.</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="tools" height="299" src="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/2/tools.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>I even got soap in a pretty bottle.</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="soap" height="494" src="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/2/soap.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>And a small, inexpensive lamp for the counter! We rent, so no major fixture installation. Just that little bit of cheerful incandescent light washing over the counter made a huge, huge different in making me feel drawn to this room. Somewhere in there I added a goat. My husband wants a pet goat, but the city won&#8217;t let anyone have goats. Little happy things like that remind me not to take cooking so seriously.</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="goat" height="321" src="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/2/goat.jpg" width="450"/></p>
<p>Because I DO take cooking too seriously.</p>
<p>But! Encouraged by the new lighting and cheered on by my bowls, I timidly began to experiment with ingredients and recipes. Some meals came out great, the kids devoured it, my husband raved and I felt like I was king of the world! Some results were terrible. My husband politely ate them, my youngest urged me to promise to &#8220;Never, ever cook this again.&#8221; and once asked, &#8220;Are you sure this recipe was supposed to be FOOD?&#8221;</p>
<p>And I felt like an idiot for wasting so much time and money and energy and ingredients making something so gross.</p>
<p>Somewhere in all of this I had a major therapuedic breakthrough: I avoid cooking because I am deeply afraid of messing up a meal. It was embarrassing. Shameful!</p>
<p>WELL.</p>
<p>The solution to that was simple: GET OVER IT.</p>
<p>And very slowly, you know what? I did. I got over it. At first by just pretending to be brave&#8230; which led to more practicing, and more mistakes, and more meals at home. And slowly my identity started to shift. I&#8217;m now a person who can be found in the kitchen, making things from scratch.</p>
<p>The other day I overheard my oldest son telling a friend, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s my mom. She makes muffins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like it was a defining trait. Haha! I say to my past self. HAHA. SHE MAKES MUFFINS.</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="muffeens" height="371" src="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/2/muffins2.jpg" width="317"/></p>
<p>There are recipes all over the internet, just trust me all of them are yummy and easy and you can have them in the oven in no time. I use things like whole wheat flour and applesauce so my kids can snack on them without me fretting about what they&#8217;re eating. Because 100mg of Zoloft can only take me so far:</p>
<p><em><strong>Neurotic Mother&#8217;s Crazy Yummy Banana Nut Muffins</strong></em></p>
<ul><li><em>Three or four ripe bananas (it&#8217;s fun to squish them up before you peel them!)</em></li>
<li><em>1/3 cup applesauce</em></li>
<li><em>1 Tablespoon of oil</em></li>
<li><em>1 egg</em></li>
<li><em>1/2 cup brown sugar</em></li>
<li><em>1 teaspoon vanilla</em></li>
<li><em>1 teaspoon baking soda</em></li>
<li><em>1.5 cups of whole wheat baking flour</em></li>
<li><em>1 cup chopped walnuts</em></li>
</ul><ol><li>Preheat oven to 350 and wonder at the amazing fact that so many recipes cook at 350. </li>
<li>In a beautiful bowl that makes you feel happy and confident, mix mashed banana, applesauce and oil.</li>
<li>Stir in sugar, egg (I read somewhere to beat the egg first when baking? So I do it but don&#8217;t yet know why), vanilla</li>
<li>Add in baking soda and salt. Stir.</li>
<li>Now! This is important! Add in the flour, but don&#8217;t overmix. You want to *just* combine it&#8230; if you super mix it the muffins will end up being dense and everyone will know that you used whole wheat flour and then they will make fun of you and hate you forever because you ruined Christmas and you will cry from being so humiliated.</li>
<li>Fold in the nuts</li>
<li>Fill muffin tins 3/4 full. Bake those pups for 25 minutes. Do the toothpick test to make sure they&#8217;re done, then put them on a plate in the middle of the table to let them cool before serving because it is hilarious to watch your kids trying to snatch muffins from the plate and then whine because they&#8217;re tooooo hot!</li>
</ol><p>So yeah. I&#8217;m Tiffany. And this year I defeated my kitchen, overcame some deeply neurotic mental habits, and by holy mother of heck, I am a person who makes muffins.</p>

<p><em>Grass-fed lean ground beef and a sprinkling of extra sharp white cheddar in a whole wheat soft shell taco; pomegranate </em>seeds; <em>tangelo orange slices; a dollop of organic reduced fat sour cream; organic stone-ground blue corn chips with sea salt; homemade guacamole</em></p>
<p><br/>Oh happy day!  My husband and I are rabid homemade guacamole fans, so naturally it&#8217;s pretty much a staple at our home.  Every once in a blue moon the kids would dip in, make a &#8220;yucky face&#8221; and declare guacamole to be &#8220;inedible.&#8221;  Such heart-breakers kids can be.  They tried other people&#8217;s guacamole with the same response, mostly complaining that in addition to being inedible it was &#8220;too mushy&#8221; (something ours apparently wasn&#8217;t, partially because my husband and I like chunks of avocados).</p>
<p>Last night I was out of red onions, so in a desperate move I tried vidalia onions as a substitute.  Guess what?  They ate it!  Not only did they eat it, but they asked that I make a fresh batch this morning to take to school in their bento boxes!  Success!  And mommy got to eat any leftovers on toast for breakfast!  Sorry for the string of exclamation points, but darn it I&#8217;m excited!</p>
<p>When it comes to foods and kids, if at first you don&#8217;t succeed&#8230;try again.  Sometimes it&#8217;s a tweak so small as trading in red onions for sweet onions.</p>
<p>Here is our recipe:</p>
<ul><li>ripe avocados</li>
<li>sea salt</li>
<li>crushed garlic</li>
<li>a bit of fresh cilantro</li>
<li>diced tomatoes</li>
<li>a little hot sauce (optional)</li>
<li>red onions (or, um&#8230;.clearly vidalia onions work)</li>
<li>fresh squeezed lime juice</li>
<li>do not puree into oblivion.  Leave some chunks!</li>
</ul><p>Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering about the change in bento appearance today, my youngest is testing out her step-brother&#8217;s <a href="http://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/planet-box-lunchbox-bts2011/?pkey=e%7Cplanetbox%7C1%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7C1&amp;group=1&amp;sku=3873114&amp;cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH%7C%7CNoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-NoMerchRules-_-">Planetbox</a> while her sister remains loyal to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaptopLunches">Laptop Lunches</a>. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Guest blogger <a href="http://www.tiffanyard.com/">Tiffany Ard</a> from <a href="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/wordpress/">Electric Boogaloo</a> will be back later in the week, quite possibly with a tasty muffin recipe, I hear. </p>

					<p>Guest blogger <a href="http://www.NerdyBaby.net" title="Nerdy Baby" target="_blank">Tiffany Ard</a> from <a href="http://www.electricboogaloo.net/wordpress/" title="electricboogaloo.net" target="_blank">Electric Boogaloo</a> is posting this week, even though she has Boisterous Boys who Brunch instead of Little Ladies who Lunch.</p>

<p><em>Templeton: How&#8217;s this? It says CRUNCHY. Crunchy would be a good word for your web.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Charlotte: Just the wrong idea. Couldn&#8217;t be worse. We don&#8217;t want Zuckerman to think Wilbur is crunchy.</em></blockquote>
<p><br/>When I was stumbling through the blurry very first early days of       parenthood, I connected with other new moms online. We had this futuristic      new wireless internet and a laptop and oh it was a line to the       outside world, a world where everyone had new babies, everyone       could laugh about diapers and grandparents, everyone could cry       about hormones and breastfeeding and body image. It was very       supportive and wonderful. But! There were certain topics that       sent all of us into panic and attack mode. Then we all       had a big internet fight, right there on the computer while holding our       precious newborns on our laps.</p>
<p>A lot of the drama centered on food. Feeding a baby, it turns       out, is not a simple personal parenting decision. It&#8217;s loaded       with pressure and guilt and fretting. <em>What if I&#8217;m not feeding him       enough? What if this is too much? Why is he spitting up so much?       What am I doing wrong?</em></p>
<p>Or, to put it in new-mom message board language: <em>What are YOU       doing wrong? Why are YOU such a bad mother? Why are you so  unconcerned about what your child eats? And why are you TOO concerned  about it? Oh I get it, you&#8217;re one of those annoying Crunchy-Granola  moms. Oh, I get it, you&#8217;re one of those gatorade and flaming hot Cheetos  moms. I don&#8217;t understand, haven&#8217;t you heard of diabetes? WHY DID YOU EVEN HAVE       THAT BABY IF YOU WERE PLANNING ON GIVING HIM APPLE JUICE TO DRINK? </em></p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Feeding our kids is a big deal and it turns out, it&#8217;s a deeply weirdly emotional topic for parents. Hoping to avoid drama I did my best to avoid falling into any extreme, avoid anything worthy of a derogatory label like <em>Crunchy Granola,</em> or anything that meant that I cared too little or too much about what my children ate. Too busy to cook, too cool to fret, yet too creeped out by preservatives to feed my baby cheetos.</p>
<p>But as much as I didn&#8217;t want feeding to be a big deal with my own  kids, in those early days food WAS a big deal. With my first son,  nursing was a       traumatic disaster. Then, the formula we gave him made him  constipated and       we had to switch and switch and switch until finally we needed to  add in a little bit of juice       to help him (see above, in all caps). When it was time to go to       solid foods we thought oh yay! The worst is over! Except my child  didn&#8217;t care for solid foods so we entered his toddler days in a  full-tilt struggle over please, seriously eat just one bite of  food.</p>
<p>Kids won&#8217;t starve themselves of course, and I knew logically that this was nothing  to panic over. I understood all of the psychology behind toddler power  grabs and the rational voices all agreed that it was fine. He was fine.</p>
<p>But we are all animals with instincts, and it turns out that MUST FEED  BABY was a gut-level thing that I could not control. It was upsetting  when he wouldn&#8217;t eat, and it was crazy satisfying when he would. And while I&#8217;d love to say that I can look back now and laugh, no &#8212; it was really a frustrating thing. I was a failure, a baby-feeding failure!</p>
<p>They both survived toddlerhood, both managed to eventually gain enough weight that I could breathe, and yet yet YET even as my kids get older, I&#8217;m still not over the thrill of seeing them devour a healthy meal.</p>
<p>All of this to get to my wicked confession: I now make granola almost every day. And I can&#8217;t describe how exciting it is. TOO exciting. Does this make me the dreaded Crunchy Granola mother? Technically, maybe, yes? Well, whatever, I  don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Granola is yummy, it&#8217;s healthy, it&#8217;s affordable, it&#8217;s easy,  it&#8217;s forgiving. And also, this:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Yum" height="383" src="http://i.imgur.com/RAzne.jpg" width="446"/></p>
<p>So what goes into my granola? I&#8217;m not great at being consistent,  so it&#8217;s a little different every time, but here&#8217;s basically what I put  in this morning&#8217;s batch:</p>
<p><strong>First, the basic dry stuff:</strong><br/> 1.5 cups of rolled oats (not instant, but this is a texture thing &#8212; you use whatever kind sounds yummy to you)<br/> 1 cup of steel cut oats (I like the crunch and the health benefits)<br/> A bunch of chopped nuts &#8212; I use pecan halves, and then I chop walnuts  and a few almonds more finely because frankly I don&#8217;t like them as much.  That way I really taste the nuts I like best.<br/> 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds<br/> 1 and a half crumbled-up brown rice cakes (so unbelievably optional)</p>
<p>You can put in whatever sounds good basically. Flax seeds, pumpkin  seeds, dried fruit, shredded coconut. No one&#8217;s watching! Go crazy with  it.</p>
<p><strong>The goopy stuff:</strong><br/> 1/2 cup of your favorite oil &#8212; I love olive oil for granola, but this isn&#8217;t about me<br/> 3/4 cup of melted super-crunchy peanut butter &#8212; because I am obsessed with peanut butter. You don&#8217;t have to use it.</p>
<p><strong>The sweet stuff:</strong><br/> Here you have options. You can use half a cup of honey, brown sugar,  maple syrup (expensive but a very delicious option), a little apple  juice (if you don&#8217;t love your children), or all of the above. Or none of the above! I sort of mix and  match, sometimes making the granola sweeter and sometimes less  sweet.</p>
<p><strong>The flavory stuff:</strong><br/> A teaspoon of cinnamon.<br/> Nutmeg<br/> Vanilla<br/> Molasses<br/> A pinch of regular old table salt (I tried coarse sea salt a few times  and personally didn&#8217;t like the way it made some bites super salty and  others not at all. But again, that&#8217;s your call)<br/> Whatever other kinds of flavors you&#8217;re into</p>
<p>NICE moms add mini chocolate chips, but I&#8217;m not nice.</p>
<p>So! What do you do with all of this stuff besides make a huge mess in your kitchen? Well, it&#8217;s pretty easy.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1.</strong> Pre-heat the oven to 325.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2.</strong> Put everything we just talked about into a large bowl and  stir until it looks absolutely disgusting. Taste a little. Add things  until it tastes yummy.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3.</strong> Pour the gross, gooping mess into a baking pan or cookie sheet.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4.</strong> Stick it in the oven and set a timer for 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 5</strong>. Beep! Your timer went off. Stir it up, make sure you get the edges because that&#8217;s what&#8217;ll burn if you leave them.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 6.</strong> Oh now I feel bad there are so many steps. Sorry. Stir it again. Set the timer for ten more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 7.</strong> One more time. Total of 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 8.</strong> Let it cool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to go through several stages: Right out of the oven it&#8217;s  like eating amazing hot cereal. An hour later it&#8217;s like eating oatmeal  cookies that went a little wrong but are still delicious. The next day?  It&#8217;s like eating the best granola EVER. And then your kids say yay! And  you say yay!</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Granolaaaaaa" height="303" src="http://i.imgur.com/3qqgu.jpg" width="441"/></p>
<p>And congratulations, you are officially a Crunchy Granola  mom. Or dad. Or person. Anyway, whatever you are, just know that people  on the internet will judge you for it. But it&#8217;s worth it because LOOK:</p>

						<h2><a href="http://littleladieswholunch.com/post/14990008619/paris-new-year-in-brooklyn">Paris New Year (in Brooklyn!)</a></h2>
					
					<div class="text_post">
					<p><img src="http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn6/aniellaina/parisNewYear.jpg"/></p>
<p>When my youngest daughter was 10 months old and my oldest was 2&#160;1/2, our family of 4 became a family of 3.  As tough as it was initially I quickly learned to embrace the role as solo parent to my 2 little girls.  </p>
<p>Shortly after relocating from Manhattan to Brooklyn I joined a local single parent support group.  It was there that I first encountered the concept of &#8220;Paris New Year,&#8221; &#8212; celebrating midnight on Paris time &#8212; <em>which translates to 6pm East Coast time.</em>  It was the perfect way to bring in the New Year with young children, as they are awake for all of the fun and excitement and mommy could still celebrate *and* be asleep by midnight to prepare for their early morning rise.  That first Paris New Year was one of the most memorable evenings of my life, as I was surrounded by dozens of people who understood the new journey I had embarked on, and, more importantly: I would later go on to marry the host of the party, himself a parent with custody of his 2 boys! </p>
<p>We continue the tradition of Paris New Year to this day, now as a family of 6, though we don&#8217;t always host anymore.  The tradition has spread like wildfire among our close friends.  If you prefer not to call a sitter and head out for an adults-only evening, Paris New Year may be just the thing for you.  And if you do decide to host yourself, be forewarned that your fellow parents will come in droves, so make it easy on yourself and declare it a potluck!</p>
<p>As long as you have some bubbly on hand (don&#8217;t forget sparkling apple cider or some other delightfully bubbly drink for the kids to toast with) you shouldn&#8217;t feel obligated to carry the French theme over to the menu.  Anything goes. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post some menu ideas and some kiddie mocktail recipes shortly (inspired by the discovery of preservative and dye-free Maraschino cherries)! </p>

					<div class="text_post">
					<p><img src="http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn6/aniellaina/tree084.jpg"/></p>
<p>This was last year&#8217;s contribution to the holiday classroom parties:  a styrofoam craft store tree painted with green acrylic paint, wrapped in plastic and then decorated with organic fruit, cheese and whole grain crackers.  Not a morsel remained.</p>
<p>To add to the cuteness factor, fill the empty platter space that surrounds the tree with air-popped popcorn.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thinking of doing something similar this year, but adding lots of honeydew and cantaloupe melon balls to make it even more festive and colorful. </p>

						<h2><a href="http://littleladieswholunch.com/post/14214641391/homemade-chinese-chicken-broccoli">Homemade Chinese Chicken &amp; Broccoli</a></h2>
					
					<div class="text_post">
					<p><img src="http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn6/aniellaina/chicenand.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Homemade leftover Chinese chicken and broccoli over brown rice; organic Granny Smith apple slices; a clementine &#8220;stuffed&#8221; with pomegranate seeds</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m all about festive Christmas colors right now.  I can&#8217;t help myself! </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s bento features last night&#8217;s homemade Chinese chicken and broccoli leftovers.  The dish is simple to prepare and tastes a million times better than the chicken and broccoli you&#8217;d find at the local take-out joint, and it&#8217;s likely to be a lot healthier, too. </p>
<p>Admittingly, the back and forth with the wok can be a bit dizzying until you get used to it, but forge ahead and you&#8217;ll be very pleased with the results.</p>
<p>The secret to avoiding &#8220;white girl stir fry&#8221; as I affectionately like to call it is to velvet the chicken first.  The full set of instructions is below.  Please give it a try!</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Chicken &amp; Broccoli</strong></p>
<p>First, velvet the chicken. To do this, mix together</p>
<ul><li>egg whites from 2 large, organic eggs</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of corn starch</li>
</ul><p>Pour the mixture over cubed, humanely raised/antibiotic-free chicken (I used 1.5 pounds) that has been placed in a bowl and mix well, taking care to thoroughly cover each chicken cube.  Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in the fridge for at least 30 minutes &#8212; longer if you can.</p>
<p>While your chicken is velveting, prep your sauce:</p>
<ul><li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
<li class="ingredient">8 tablespoons light (reduced sodium) soy sauce</li>
<li class="ingredient">8 tablespoons filtered water</li>
<li class="ingredient">2 cloves of minced garlic</li>
<li class="ingredient">grated ginger to taste</li>
</ul><p>You&#8217;ll be able to adjust the sauce to your own liking eventually, but this is a good base. </p>
<p>In another small bowl, prepare thickener and then combine with the above sauce:</p>
<p>2 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of filtered water &#8212; thoroughly blended (I use a mini whisk). </p>
<p>1.  wash and drain the broccoli (I used 2 bunches). Cut the stalk diagonally into thin slices. Cut the flowerets  into 3 or 4 pieces and set aside.</p>
<p>2.  Heat 1/3rd of a cup of canola oil (organic, expeller-pressed, if possible) in a wok (around 275 degrees if you want to be technical).  Add the chicken cubes, and let cook until they just turn  white all over, using a wooden spoon or chopsticks to gently  separate them. Quickly remove the chicken cubes from the wok as soon as  they turn white, and drain in a colander or on paper towels.</p>
<p>3.  Drain the oil out of the wok or preheat a second wok on medium high  to high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil is hot, add the  crushed garlic and stir fry for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>4.  Add the broccoli, sprinkle salt and sugar over to taste, and stir fry  briefly, turning down the heat if necessary to make sure it doesn&#8217;t  burn. Add the 1 cup water, and cook the broccoli, covered, for 4 - 5  minutes, until it turns a bright green and is tender but still crisp.  Remove from the wok and drain.</p>
<p>5. Clean out the wok and heat 2 more tablespoons oil. Add the broccoli  and the chicken together, stirring and tossing to cook the chicken  through. Add the sauce and cornstarch mixture in the middle of the wok  and stir quickly to thicken. Mix everything together and serve hot over brown rice.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>Yesterday was a lovely family day at our house.  We took a brisk walk around Prospect Park (3.53 miles on this particular route), played games, made hot mulled cider, baked ourselves a breakfast treat to wake up to on Monday morning and cooked a Sunday dinner of whole wheat pappardelle sprinkled with fresh parmesan cheese, turkey meatballs, tomato basil sauce and homemade garlic bread made from whole roasted garlic.  Afterward we snuck in a little bit of &#8220;A Christmas Carol.&#8221; </p>
<p>Days like these are important to my husband and me, as they keep us focused on what matters to us most during the holiday season, far away from the excess that surrounds us all.</p>
<p>It was nice to wake up this morning to the fruits of our labor and treat ourselves to a little slice of the weekend, inspired by <a href="http://acozykitchen.com/cranberry-oat-banana-bread/">this recipe</a> from A Cozy Kitchen. </p>
<ul><li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup rolled oats, plus 1 handful for topping</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of baking powder (aluminum free)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (aluminum free)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/3 cup light buttermilk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of canola oil (organic, expeller-pressed, if possible)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of pure organic vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 large, organic eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
<li>1/4 cup Turbinado sugar</li>
<li>3 over-ripe bananas (please don&#8217;t cut corners here &#8212; the must be over-ripe)</li>
<li>1 cup of cranberries</li>
</ul><p><br/>1. Pre-heat oven to 325˚F. Lightly grease a 9x5-inch pan and dust with a tablespoon of flour.<br/><br/>2. In a medium bowl, mix together all-purpose flour, whole wheat pastry flour, rolled oats, baking powder, baking soda and salt.<br/><br/>3.  In a measuring cup, measure out the buttermilk. To the buttermilk, add  the vegetable oil and vanilla extract and mix until combined. <br/><br/>4.  In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat eggs, light brown sugar  and white sugar together until thick and pale, approximately 3-5  minutes. Mix in smashed banana and buttermilk mixture. In two batches,  add flour mixture, mixing until just combined, being sure not to  over-mix.<br/><br/>5. Fold in cranberries and transfer batter to prepared loaf pan. Top with a handful of rolled oats.<br/><br/>6.  Bake quick bread for 50 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center  comes out clean. Invert bread onto a rack to cool. Cranberry Oatmeal  Banana Bread will be moist up to 3-4 days. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap  to preserve its freshness.</p>

<p>Yes, I timed how long it took me to make today&#8217;s lunch of almond butter on whole wheat bakery bread with a teaspoon of local blackberry jam, navel orange slices with a few organic cranberries for color, and organic apple slices tossed with ground cinnamon.</p>
<p>All that was needed to make the sandwich was a round cutter (ours has crimped edges, although you can&#8217;t tell from the photo) and a smaller Christmas tree press. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been ages since we&#8217;ve used a cookie cutter to shape sandwiches, but now that the tree is up and we&#8217;ve seen Santa, it seemed like a good time for the festive lunches to begin again.</p>

						<h2><a href="http://littleladieswholunch.com/post/13501251702/the-last-of-the-leftovers-thanksgiving-wrap-up">The Last of the Leftovers &amp; Thanksgiving Wrap-Up</a></h2>
					
					<div class="text_post">
					<p><img src="http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn6/aniellaina/pretzel.jpg"/></p>
<p>Unlike most families, ours never seems to tire of turkey.  Today&#8217;s bento features the last of the turkey breast thinly sliced and served on pretzel bread (a special treat) smeared with a little homemade cranberry sauce with hints of citrus.  The sides consist of fresh kiwi, naval orange slices with pomegranate seeds and a salad of diced red bell peppers and cucumber. </p>
<p>Thanksgiving was an extraordinary feast for 14 after rising early to do our local 5 mile Turkey Trot.  The whole family including our kids ages 6, 8, 12 and 16 participated.  We felt like champions (walkers/runners and eaters)! </p>
<p>My favorite part of Thanksgiving was watching all of the children involve themselves in the prep.  My 6 year old grated cheeses.  My 8 year old made the homemade cranberry sauce using half water and half fresh squeezed orange juice, sugar (not as much as previous years) and grated clementine rind.  My 16 year old stepson made pumpkin pie for the first time using a recipe from <a href="http://ronniefein.com/">Kitchen Vignettes</a>. And my 12 year old stepson acted as a runner and pinch-hitter on a little bit of everything, including walking and entertaining the dog and running out for last minute forgotten items so the rest of us could continue cooking and cleaning. </p>
<p>All in all, it was a wonderful time. </p>

			<div class="about">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Little Ladies Who Lunch was inspired by a diagnosis of FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA for 3 out of 6  household members (myself and my 2 young daughters) just days before the start of the 2010-2011 school year.  <br />
<br />
The panic that ensued quickly gave way to "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade."  And preserved lemons.  And lemon roasted chicken.  And low-fat lemon yogurt cake.  You get the picture.<br />
<br />
Please be sure to check out our "Beyond Lunches" section for healthy alternatives to traditional party, holiday and in-classroom food ideas, as well as homemade snacks.<br />
